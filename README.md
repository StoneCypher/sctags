New tag components for x-tags/polymer

This is a repository of new html tags for the W3C Web Component technology stack.  At the time of writing, it's expected
that these would be used with a polyfill shim set like [Mozilla X-Tags](http://www.x-tags.org/) or 
[Google Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org).

This repo is written by [John Haugeland](http://fullof.bs/).
