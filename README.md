# sctags

## New tag components for [X-Tags](http://www.x-tags.org/) / [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org)

This is a repository of new HTML tags for the W3C Web Component technology stack.  At the time of writing, 
it's expected that these would be used with a polyfill shim set like [Mozilla X-Tags](http://www.x-tags.org/) 
or [Google Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org).  However, with time, browsers are expected to support
the upcoming W3 standards ##todo.

`sctags`, like its cousin library [scutil](https://github.com/StoneCypher/scutil.github.com/), is a pretty
wide ranging library plan in relatively early state.  However, from a quick look at the other, it's clear
that these plans do pan out with time.  `:)`

Extractable docs soon.
